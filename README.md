### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jay. I'm a data scientist, and I currently live in Washington, DC. I primarily do machine learning and data analysis, with some web development and devops on the side. Nowadays, I mostly program in Python, though I also sometimes use R. In a former life, I was an aerospace engineer and wrote a lot of MATLAB. 

:sparkles:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Open Source Projects**

Some of the open source projects I maintain include:

- [cloudpathlib](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cloudpathlib): pathlib-style classes for cloud storage services
- [deon](https://github.com/drivendataorg/deon): a data science ethics checklist framework and tool
- [erdantic](https://github.com/drivendataorg/erdantic): entity-relationship diagrams for Python data classes like Pydantic
- [pkgnet](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet): an R package for network analysis of R package dependencies and structure
- [quickhttp](https://github.com/jayqi/quickhttp): lightweight http server with automatic port-finding and shutdown
- [reprexlite](https://github.com/jayqi/reprexlite): render reproducible examples of Python code for sharing
- [spongebob](https://github.com/jayqi/spongebob): a collection of tools for creating text in moCkInG SPoNGeboB cAsE
