### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jay. I'm a data scientist :computer: and currently living in Oakland, CA. I mostly program in Python and R. In a former life, I was an aerospace engineer :airplane: :rocket:. 

:sparkles:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Open Source Projects**

Some of the open source projects I maintain include:

- [deon](https://github.com/drivendataorg/deon): a data science ethics checklist framework and tool
- [pkgnet](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet): an R package for network analysis of R package dependencies and structure
- [spongebob](https://github.com/jayqi/spongebob): a collection of tools for creating text in moCkInG SPoNGeboB cAsE

:sunny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**My Day Job**

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.co/), where I do full-stack data science consulting for social impact organizations.

Feel free to direct-message me if you'd like to chat about open source, data science careers, data for social and civic good, data ethics, space exploration, or anything else.
